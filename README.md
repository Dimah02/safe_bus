# 🛡️ SAFE - School Advanced Flow Engine

A smart, real-time school bus tracking and management system developed using **Flutter** for the mobile app and **ASP.NET Core** for the backend. Created as a graduation project at Applied Science Private University, SAFE enhances student safety, optimizes bus routes, and improves communication among parents, drivers, assistant teachers, and administrators.

## 📱 Overview

SAFE addresses the challenges of traditional school transportation systems—such as route inefficiencies, lack of real-time visibility, and communication breakdowns—by providing:

- Real-time GPS tracking of school buses
- Route optimization
- Attendance logging
- Role-based mobile and web interfaces
- Notifications and administrative dashboards

This project contributes to **Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs), particularly **SDG 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and **SDG 17** (Partnerships for the Goals).
